## Testing <img src="https://github.com/Samridhi-98/Images/blob/master/Images/test.svg" width="3%">
* The endpoint `usertest` which follows the same schema as the `users/` endpoint, must be used for testing
* All other endpoints except `usertest` should involve methods which **must not** change the data on the server (read-only)
* To test the endpoints provided by the application, tools such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used
