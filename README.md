## Installation

### Before you setup project, make sure you have pre-commit installed on your machine. Skip the following if you have already installed.

There are 3 ways to install pre-commit package manager

-   Using pip:

`$ pip install pre-commit`

-   Using homebrew:

`$ brew install pre-commit`

-   Using conda (via conda-forge):

`$ conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit`

After completing the above steps, verify your installation by running

`$ pre-commit --version`

### Maintaining Consistency

It is absolutely necessary for us to maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on this same project across various editors and IDEs. We have created a editorconfig file and urge you to download editorconfig plugin before further installation.

Setup for 3 major editors

-   For vscode

    -   Download the following [plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) on your editor

-   For atom

    -   Download the following [plugin](https://atom.io/packages/editorconfig) on your editor

-   For Sublime text
    -   Download the following [plugin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime) on your editor

## Testing <img src="https://github.com/Samridhi-98/Images/blob/master/Images/test.svg" width="3%">

-   The endpoint `usertest` which follows the same schema as the `users/` endpoint, must be used for testing
-   All other endpoints except `usertest` should involve methods which **must not** change the data on the server (read-only)
-   To test the endpoints provided by the application, tools such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used
