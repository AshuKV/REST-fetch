</p>

A community-owned REST API service for testers and developers. Fetch provides REST API endpoints for different types of placeholders, which can be easily used during testing and development without the need for creating sample data manually.

The project is live [here](https://rest-fetch.herokuapp.com/)



## Installation
Follow the instructions to get started with the project on your local machine ðŸš€
* Fork and clone the project
* `cd fetch/` and run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Setup [mongodb atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/dalalrohit/how-to-connect-to-mongodb-atlas-using-node-js-k9i)
* Enter the credentials in `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
* Run `npm run dev` to run the project in development

## Testing
* The endpoint `usertest` which follows the same schema as the `users/` endpoint, must be used for testing
* All other endpoints except `usertest` should involve methods which **must not** change the data on the server (read-only)
* To test the endpoints provided by the application, tools such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used
