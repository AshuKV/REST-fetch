</p>

A community-owned REST API service for testers and developers. Fetch provides REST API endpoints for different types of placeholders, which can be easily used during testing and development without the need for creating sample data manually.

The project is live [here](https://rest-fetch.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation
Follow the instructions to get started with the project on your local machine ðŸš€
* Fork and clone the project
* Install and configure your [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), following [this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
* Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and provide the username, password and database name of choice.
* Once docker is installed run the followig commands.
  * `docker-compose build`
  * Once the build is complete, run `docker-compose up`

## Testing
* The endpoint `usertest` which follows the same schema as the `users/` endpoint, must be used for testing
* All other endpoints except `usertest` should involve methods which **must not** change the data on the server (read-only)
* To test the endpoints provided by the application, tools such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used
