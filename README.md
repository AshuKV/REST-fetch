</p>

A community-owned REST API service for testers and developers. Fetch provides REST API endpoints for different types of placeholders, which can be easily used during testing and development without the need for creating sample data manually.

The project is live [here](https://rest-fetch.herokuapp.com/)



## Installation
There are two ways of installing the project on your local Machine ðŸš€
* Using Docker
  * Fork and clone the project
  * Install and configure your [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), following [this](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
  * Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
  * Once docker is installed run the followig commands.
    * `docker-compose build`
    * Once the build is complete, run `docker-compose up`

* Conventional Setup
  * Fork and clone the project
  * `cd fetch/` and run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * Setup [mongodb atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/dalalrohit/how-to-connect-to-mongodb-atlas-using-node-js-k9i)
  * Enter the credentials in `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`.
  * Make sure to set `USE_DOCKER= false` in `.env` file.
  * Run `npm run dev` to run the project in development


## Testing
* The endpoint `usertest` which follows the same schema as the `users/` endpoint, must be used for testing
* All other endpoints except `usertest` should involve methods which **must not** change the data on the server (read-only)
* To test the endpoints provided by the application, tools such as [postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used
